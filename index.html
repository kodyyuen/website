          I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at Northeastern University majoring in 
          Computer Science with a concentration in software. I love solving problems and finding logical
          solutions to them. I also love simplifying everyday tasks to be as efficient and smooth as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am looking for either:
          <br>- a co-op/internship in the Boston area starting in January 2023 through August 2023
          <br>- a full-time job starting in May 2023

        Photoshop Recreation
      </h3>
      <div class="project-item">
        <img class="project-img" src="images/photoshop.JPG">
        <p>
          This project was an attempt at a recreation of photoshop. The program included some of photoshop's 
          features such as applying filters (blurring and sharpening) and transformations (greyscale and sepia) to 
          images, downscaling images, and saving and loading images. Similar to photoshop, users were also able to 
          manipulate layers of images. They were able to make any layer visible/invisible and apply any of the previous 
          features to it. If the second layer was greyscaled and the first layer was made invisible, the GUI would display 
          the greyscaled layer. The program also supports the option to save and load images in ppm, jpg, and png. It is also 
          able to hold the state of the image, so if the image described before was saved, it would be able to load the image 
          back with the first layer invisible and the second layer greyscaled and the user would be able to pick up where they left off.

        Self-Solving Maze
      </h3>
      <div class="project-item">
        <img class="project-img" src="images/maze.png">
        <p>
          The program that I created is a maze that can either be self-solved using depth-first search or breadth-first search. The program also has an option to let the user take manual control and try to solve the maze themselves. At first, I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to even start coding a self-solving maze. Although, I realized that I could see the maze as a set of nodes and edges. When trying to solve the maze manually, the program is also able to keep track of your moves and how many you are making. As you move, the path that you are taking is displayed. Once you reach the end, you are shown how many incorrect moves you made, if any. Since DFS and BFS aren't the most efficient searching algorithms, the program used Dijkstra's algorithm instead. Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path between nodes in a graph, and since I was treating my maze as a collection of nodes and graphs, it was perfect for my use case.

      Discord Bot
    </h3>
    <div class="project-item">
      <img class="project-img" src="images/discord.png">
      <p>
        I made this Discord bot over the summer as a fun personal project. I started the project because I wanted to get back into coding and learn some Python. I was also getting very interested in the stock market and cryptocurrency at the time. So, I coded a bot that has several commands related to that using the Discord library. Using public APIs that I found online, I was able to create commands that call on requests, parse the JSONs that I received back, and format the information I wanted in an embedded message in Discord. My commands include a currency converter between cryptocurrency and fiat, and stock commands which take in the ticker and can return the current stock price, current news of the company, or a summary of the company.
